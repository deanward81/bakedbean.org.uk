Hi there! My name is Dean Ward and I'm a principal engineer in the Azure App Services group at Microsoft. I mostly work on building performant systems and the infrastructure to do allow others to do so.

Once upon a time I used to work on the Platform Engineering Team at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) doing similar stuffs.
