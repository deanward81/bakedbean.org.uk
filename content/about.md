Hi there! My name is Dean Ward and I'm a developer on the Architecture Team at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Our team's primary task is to make sure other teams can do their jobs effectively by providing them with code & architecture guidance, provisioning infrastructure with the help of our SRE team, addressing tech debt and longer term projects like our migration to .NET Core.

If you're interested in some of the things we work on as a team I'd recommend reading the blogs of [Nick Craver](https://nickcraver.com/), [Marc Gravell](http://marcgravell.com) & [Samo Prelog](https://m0sa.net/)!
